# SQL-Queries
### This respiratory includes SQL file based on university coursework. The task was to create database and then write different types of queries 

In a group of 4 students. The coursework consists of 4 parts:

- Part 1: Database creation. Based on the schema you choose, we ask you to create a minimum of 5 tables using SQL CREATE commands. We expect to see constraints (e.g. key constraints) being used, we also expect to see an instance of Generalisation (2 MARKS).
You should then populate your tables with at least 10 rows of data per table using SQL INSERT statements (2 MARKS).

	- Part 2: Basic queries. Write 2 basic but non-trivial SQL queries using dates, joins or functions. SELECT * FROM table will not be accepted. Example: customers who booked a room whose price is greater than 200 (2 MARKS).

	- Part 3: Medium queries. Write 3 (2 if you're working alone) medium queries using group-by and complex joins (self-joins, outer joins). Example: customers who booked a comfort room and a luxury room, all rooms with the customers who booked them including the rooms no customer has booked (3 MARKS).

	- Part 4: Advanced queries. Write 3 (2 if you're working alone) advanced queries using nested queries, set-based conditions or aggregations. Example: show customers who booked more rooms than the average customer (i.e. the average number of rooms), all customers who booked mostly luxury rooms (e.g. more than 90% of the bookings were for luxury rooms) (6 MARKS).


#### I was mainly responsible for the analysis and creation of Advanced queries
